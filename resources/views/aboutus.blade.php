            <p>
                CareX (Appointment system with health level 7) is an online appointment booking 
system where you can book appointment of your consult doctors and also book 
appointment for medical tests. It gives relief to you because now you don’t have to visit 
to the hospital for taking an appointment and wait for your turn in the waiting room 
instead of this you can easily book appointment online from the application and it will 
also notify you time to time and gives reminder of your appointment turn. It saves your 
time and manage a large number of people efficiently as if the different patients (Infected 
with different diseases) are waiting in the same area so many diseases are quickly 
communicative and they can affect others as well so this application also protects you 
from the communicative diseases.
Usually when going to the hospital, people have to take all the medical documents with 
them to show to their consult doctors and number of times many documents misplaces so 
this application is also providing a facility of uploading the medical reports on the 
application.
Many of the time when people want to consult with the doctor immediately or want to 
ask any query so they should have to call/message the doctor on his/her personal phone if 
they have the doctor’s contact information otherwise, they have to visit to the hospital so 
this application provides a facility of quick consultation where patients can chat with the 
doctor, ask any query and they can verify their medical reports by staying at home. It also 
provides a facility of online pharmacy where a person can easily search medications and 
buy easily and he/she can also check the medicine overview and warnings from the 
application.
Our criteria for success would be that our application gives a great experience to the user 
and efficient enough to working properly with a large number of registered users.
